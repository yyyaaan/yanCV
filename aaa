# Passion in Data Science

tags$p("I have extended my masterâ€™s degree study in business to statistics because of the love in data. Statistics and business study together offer a wonderful combination to explore the stories behind numbers. For me, it is joy to work with data and I see an insightful report and elegant visualisation the greatest reward."), tags$p("During my leisure time, I continue both academic and non-academic researches related to modern data science. My personal data-sever (https://boring.fi | R-server based with Shiny), made in Google Cloud Platform, collects a few of my projects, which can serve as an indicator for my competence of visualisation and advance R programming")

tags$p("My CV attached should tell the most important elements. However, I would like to ensure Yousician team about my self-motivated working and learning. My recent independent project since spring 2017 featured for the integration of data sources and interactive visualisation with deep customised App Script associating with php-based API. Despite my education backgrounds are in business and statistics, my incentives to learn and to explore enabled the capability in programming, including R, App Script (JavaScript), VBA, php, python... (list can extend indefinitely whenever needed). I had brief experience in SQL back to the dates in Bank of Shanghai. With the help of modern technology, SQL can be achieved in alternative higher level interface while I am always ready for further learning.")


Surrounded by Yousician artists and genius, I firmly believe that TEAM makes music nice, learning easier and ultimately business more rewarding.
